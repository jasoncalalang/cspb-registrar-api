# Registrar API

This project is a Spring Boot application providing a simple registrar API. The OpenAPI definition is in `docs/swagger.yaml` and the database schema is created using Flyway migrations under the `sql` directory.

## Prerequisites

- **Java 21** – required by the Gradle toolchain.

### Example: creating a student

```json
[
  {
    "lrn": "123456789012",
    "lastName": "Doe",
    "firstName": "John",
    "birthDate": "2000-01-01",
    "birthPlace": "Manila",
    "gender": "M",
    "nationality": "Filipino",
    "religion": "Catholic",
    "address": {
      "houseNo": "123",
      "streetSubd": "Main St",
      "bgyCode": "B1"
    },
    "requirements": [
      {
        "requirementTypeId": 1,
        "submitted": true,
        "submittedDate": "2024-01-05"
      }
    ],
    "parents": [
      {
        "role": "father",
        "firstName": "John",
        "lastName": "Doe",
        "contactNum": "09171234567"
      }
    ]
  }
]
```

## Running Locally

1. **Database** – The application requires a PostgreSQL database. Configure the connection via environment variables or an `application.properties` file:

    ```properties
    spring.datasource.url=jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/registrar
    spring.datasource.username=postgres
    spring.datasource.password=secret
    spring.application.name=registrar
    spring.jpa.open-in-view=false
    spring.datasource.hikari.max-lifetime=300000
    spring.flyway.clean-disabled=false
    ```

    Flyway will automatically apply the migrations from `sql/` on startup.

2. **Start the application**

    ```bash
    ./gradlew bootRun
    ```

    The API will be available at `http://localhost:8080`.
    Visiting the root path (`/`) displays a simple landing page with a link to
    the Swagger UI (`/swagger-ui.html`).

## Running Tests

The tests use Mockito to mock the data layer so Docker is not required.

```bash
./gradlew test
```

Test reports can be found under `build/reports/tests/test` after execution.

### Contract tests

Pact provider tests are included to verify contracts generated by consumer
applications. Place pact files under `src/test/resources/pacts` or configure
`pactbroker.url` to fetch them from a Pact Broker UI. Execute them with:

```bash
./gradlew test
```


## Docker Image

This project provides a multi-stage Dockerfile. Build the image and push it under `jasoncalalang/cspb-api:1.0` using:

```bash
docker build -t jasoncalalang/cspb-api:1.0 .
docker push jasoncalalang/cspb-api:1.0
```

The build stage uses `gradle:8.14.2-jdk21-alpine` while the runtime stage uses
`docker.io/library/eclipse-temurin:21-jdk-alpine-3.21`.

### GitHub Actions secrets

The workflow under `.github/workflows/ci.yml` pushes the Docker image to Docker
Hub. Add the following secrets to your repository under **Settings → Secrets and
variables → Actions**:

- `DOCKER_USERNAME` – your Docker Hub username
- `DOCKERHUB_TOKEN` – a Docker Hub access token

The workflow logs in using `docker/login-action@v3` and these two secrets.
